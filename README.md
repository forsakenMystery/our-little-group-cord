## What is this?
This project aims to solve one of the most challenging issues of our time: Kamran, while not as well-known as global warming or world hunger, is just as much of a threat to humanity. Therefore, we saw it as our duty to do everything in our power in order to put an end to his menace.

## What does it do?
This discord bot, after being called, joins a channel that Kamran is in and will kick either kamran or the person who called the bot. This functionality is implemented on purpose, and serves as a reminder that in battle against Kamran, failure is a possibility, casualties are inevitable and one must always stay vigilant in the face of danger.

> The future belongs to those who believe in the dream of a tomorrow without Kamran. ___-Franklin D. Roosevelt___

> Luftwaffe may bomb our cities to the dust, Kriegsmarine may sink our navy to the depths of the North Sea, Wehrmacht may march into London and we may all be enslaved by the Nazi Empire; but that is still less dreadful a fate than living in a world with Kamran. ___-Winston Churchill___
